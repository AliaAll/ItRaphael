# ItRaphael

Interactive Map JavaScript Code
This JavaScript code creates an interactive map using the Raphael library. The map consists of several regions, each defined by SVG path data. Users can interact with the map by clicking on different regions, and the code provides styling for the regions as well.

Instructions for Use:
Include the Raphael library in your HTML file. Make sure to load it before this JavaScript code.

html
Copy code
<script src="path/to/raphael.js"></script>
Create an HTML container element for the map. This element should have an id attribute set to "map".

html
Copy code
<div id="map"></div>
Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into your project.

Customize the map by adding or modifying regions. Each region is defined using SVG path data. You can adjust the path data, colors, and other styling properties.

Example Customization:
javascript
Copy code
var regions = {};
regions["NewRegion"] = map.path("your_updated_SVG_path_data_here");
Dependencies:
Raphael library
Notes:
Ensure that the Raphael library is accessible in your project.
Customize the regions based on your specific requirements.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. Happy mapping
